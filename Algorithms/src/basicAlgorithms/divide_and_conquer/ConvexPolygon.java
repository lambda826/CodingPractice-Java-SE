	A polygon is called convex if all of its internal angles are less than 180�� and none of the edges cross each other.
	We represent a convex polygon as an array V with n elements, where each element represents a vertex of the polygon in the form of a coordinate pair (x, y). 
	We are told that V [1] is the vertex with the least x coordinate and that the vertices V [1], V [2], . . . , V [n] are ordered counter-clockwise. 
	Assuming that the x coordinates (and the y coordinates) of the vertices are all distinct, do the following.
	(a) Give a divide and conquer algorithm to find the vertex with the largest x coordinate in O(log n) time.
	(b) Give a divide and conquer algorithm to find the vertex with the largest y coordinate in O(log n) time.
