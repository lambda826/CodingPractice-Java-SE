Consider an array A of n numbers with the assurance that n > 2, A[1] �? A[2] and A[n] �?
A[n �? 1]. An index i is said to be a local minimum of the array A if it satisfies 1 < i < n,
A[i �? 1] �? A[i] and A[i + 1] �? A[i].
(a) Prove that there always exists a local minimum for A.
(b) Design an algorithm to compute a local minimum of A. Your algorithm is allowed to
make at most O(log n) pairwise comparisons between elements of A.
