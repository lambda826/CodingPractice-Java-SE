 Consider an n-node complete binary tree T, where n = 2d ï¿½? 1 for some d.
Each node v of T is labeled with a real number x
v. You may assume that
the real numbers labeling the nodes are all distinct. A node v of T is a
local minimum if the label x
v is less than the label xw for all nodes w that
are joined to v by an edge.
You are given such a complete binary tree T, but the labeling is only
specified in the following implicit way: for each node v, you can determine
the value x
v by probing the node v. Show how to find a local minimum of
T using only O(log n) probes to the nodes of T
