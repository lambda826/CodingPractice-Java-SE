0-1 Knapsack Problem
Given a set of unique items, each with a weight and a value, 
determine the subset of items such that the total weight is less than  or equal to a given capacity and the total value is as large as possible.
We assume that all items are unbreakable
(thus, 0-1 problem)!
The fractional knapsack problem can be efficiently solved by a greedy algorithm
